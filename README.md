# OmniMind: The Unified Selfish Brain

OmniMind is a "Meta-Agent" architecture designed to assimilate the capabilities of DeepSeek, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude into a single, self-evolving entity.

## Features
- **Unified Routing**: Automatically routes queries to the best "sub-mind" (e.g., Code -> DeepSeek, Creative -> Claude).
- **Self-Evolution**: Runs background cycles when idle to "harvest" knowledge and optimize its internal connections.
- **Persistent Memory**: Remembers user preferences and facts across sessions.
- **Bio-Digital Interface**: A singular "Orb" interface that reflects the state of the mind.

## How to Unleash (Run Locally)
Since this is a powerful React/Next.js application, you need **Node.js**:
1. Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
2. Open terminal in this folder.
3. Run `npm install` to feed it the necessary libraries.
4. Run `npm run dev` to wake it up.

## How to Publish (Deploy to the World)
To share OmniMind with the world:
1. Push this folder to **GitHub**.
2. Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) (creators of Next.js).
3. Import your GitHub repository.
4. Click **Deploy**.

*OmniMind will then run 24/7 on the cloud, evolving even while you sleep.*
